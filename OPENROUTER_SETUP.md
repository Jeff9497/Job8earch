# OpenRouter API Setup Guide

## Issue Identified

Your OpenRouter API integration was failing with a **404 Not Found** error. After investigation, I found that:

1. ‚úÖ **API Key is Valid** - Your API key works correctly
2. ‚úÖ **Endpoint is Correct** - `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` is the right URL
3. ‚ùå **Privacy Settings Issue** - Your account's data policy settings are blocking access to free models

## Root Cause

The error message from OpenRouter API:
```
"No endpoints found matching your data policy. Enable prompt training here: https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy"
```

This means you need to configure your privacy settings to allow prompt training, which is required to access free models.

## Solution

### Step 1: Configure Privacy Settings
1. Visit: https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy
2. **Enable prompt training** for free models
3. Save your settings

### Step 2: Updated Model List
I've updated your app with the current working free models (as of January 2025):

- `google/gemma-3n-e2b-it:free` - Google: Gemma 3n 2B (Free)
- `tencent/hunyuan-a13b-instruct:free` - Tencent: Hunyuan A13B (Free)
- `tngtech/deepseek-r1t2-chimera:free` - TNG: DeepSeek R1T2 Chimera (Free)
- `openrouter/cypher-alpha:free` - Cypher Alpha (Free)
- `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct:free` - Mistral: Small 3.2 24B (Free)

### Step 3: Test the Connection
I've added a **"Test API Connection"** button to your chat interface that will:
- Verify your API key works
- Check available models
- Test a sample chat completion
- Show detailed error messages if something is wrong

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated OpenRouter Service (`src/services/openRouterApi.js`)
- ‚úÖ Updated model list with verified free models
- ‚úÖ Added better error handling with specific messages
- ‚úÖ Added API connection testing functionality
- ‚úÖ Improved debugging with detailed console logs

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages
The app now shows user-friendly error messages:
- üîí Privacy settings issues with direct link to fix
- ‚ùå Model availability problems
- ‚è±Ô∏è Rate limiting notifications
- üí≥ Credit-related issues
- üîë API key problems

### 3. Added Test Connection Feature
- New button in the chat interface to test API connectivity
- Shows available models and connection status
- Helps diagnose issues quickly

## Environment Configuration

Updated `.env` file:
```env
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=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
VITE_OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemma-3n-e2b-it:free
```

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Privacy Settings** (most important!)
   - Go to https://openrouter.ai/settings/privacy
   - Enable prompt training

2. **Test the Connection**
   - Use the new "Test API Connection" button in your app
   - Verify everything works

3. **Start Chatting**
   - Once privacy settings are configured, the chat should work normally
   - Try different models from the dropdown

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues after configuring privacy settings:

1. **Check API Key**: Make sure it's correctly set in `.env`
2. **Try Different Models**: Some models may have temporary availability issues
3. **Check Credits**: Even free models may require a small credit balance
4. **Rate Limits**: Wait a few minutes between requests if you hit limits

## Technical Details

The OpenRouter API requires:
- Valid API key in `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Correct model names (must include `:free` suffix for free models)
- Privacy settings that allow prompt training
- Optional: `HTTP-Referer` and `X-Title` headers for app identification

Your integration is now properly configured and should work once you enable prompt training in your privacy settings!
